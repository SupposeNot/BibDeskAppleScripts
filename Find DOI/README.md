# Description and use #

Used for finding DOI entries.  

* Select a record containing an author and/or title.
* Run this script.
* You will get up to 3 dialogs listing potential matches. 
* If you accept one, itâ€™s corresponding DOI will be included into your record.
* If you skip all three potential matches, the script ends without adding any DOI.

I will often fill in part of the Author and Title fields (perhaps copying from a PDF I've imported) and then run this script. Assuming it finds a DOI, I will then run my "Fill according to DOI" script.  Viola -- a full entry with minimal typing.

# Requirement

* JSON Helper for AppleScript <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/json-helper-for-applescript/id453114608?mt=12>
* Satimage.osax <http://www.satimage.fr/software/en/downloads/downloads_companion_osaxen.html>

Also, of course, you'll need to edit paths to reflect wherever you've stored your bibliography.bib file.

Many thanks to everyone else who has written Applescripts. Actually seeing something in practice makes all the difference when it comes to writing scripts.
